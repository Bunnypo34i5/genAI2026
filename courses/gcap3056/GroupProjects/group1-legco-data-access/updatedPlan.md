we first fetch some articles from SCMP that covers legislative council matters 
by doing site specific search and also visit https://www.scmp.com/topics/legislative-council-hong-kong

we'll identify key topics and issues about Legco covered and what types of data journalists need 
then we check and review the three data sources again /Users/simonwang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-HongKongBaptistUniversity/GenAI2026-temp/genai2026/courses/gcap3056/GroupProjects/group1-legco-data-access/outlineDraft.md and /Users/simonwang/Library/CloudStorage/OneDrive-HongKongBaptistUniversity/GenAI2026-temp/genai2026/courses/gcap3056/GroupProjects/group1-legco-data-access/ 

we want to assess the extent to which the journalists' needs can be met with the website sources 
we also need a list of SCMP reporters and their email addresses and their recent articles on Legco so we can contact them 

do some research and web search based on the notes above
