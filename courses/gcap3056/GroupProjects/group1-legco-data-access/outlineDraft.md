# Draft Report Outline: LegCo Data Access for Healthcare Policy

## Title (placeholder)
- Connecting the Dots: Making LegCo Data Work for Citizens Concerned About Healthcare Policy

## Executive Summary
- [To be written after the report is drafted]
- Key point: fragmented LegCo data systems make it difficult for ordinary citizens to locate relevant policy discussions and hold the government accountable

## Background: The Problem
- Citizens seeking information about government programmes (e.g. rare disease support, healthcare policy) face **fragmented data sources**:
  - LegCo databases (Hansard, Bills, Q&A)
  - Open LegCo / OData API
  - DATA.GOV.HK datasets
  - Hospital Authority statistics
- These systems are **not interconnected** — no unified search or cross-referencing
- A citizen trying to trace a specific policy discussion must search multiple platforms manually
- Reference: `WebSearchReport.md` (5 rounds of search on LegCo data infrastructure), `dataReport.md`

## Existing Solution
- LegCo provides several databases: [LegCo Databases](https://www.legco.gov.hk/en/visiting/library/legco-databases.html)
- Open Data portal: [Open LegCo](https://www.legco.gov.hk/general/english/open-legco/open-data.html)
- DATA.GOV.HK: [LegCo datasets](https://data.gov.hk/en-datasets/provider/legco)
- Each system serves a different purpose but they are not linked

## Room for Improvement
- **Hypothesis 1:** A unified API or cross-referencing system could connect LegCo data sources, making policy tracking easier for citizens
- **Hypothesis 2:** The current data infrastructure does not adequately support public engagement with legislative processes
- **Questions to explore:**
  - What technical barriers prevent integration?
  - Has LegCo considered a unified search platform?
  - How do other legislatures (e.g. UK Parliament, US Congress) make their data accessible?

## Government's Replies to Our Enquiries
- [Placeholder — questions to be sent under Code on Access to Information]
- **Suggested questions:**
  - What plans does LegCo have to improve cross-referencing between its databases?
  - What is the current usage data for the Open Data portal?
  - Has any feasibility study been conducted on a unified legislative data platform?

## Complaints and Follow-up
- [Placeholder — to be developed based on government replies]
- The government should make it easier for citizens to access and navigate LegCo records on specific policy topics

## Suggestions for Media Investigation and Coverage
- **Angle:** "Why is it so hard for Hong Kong citizens to find out what the government is doing about [specific topic]?"
- Potential letter to the editor (SCMP) on data accessibility and government transparency
