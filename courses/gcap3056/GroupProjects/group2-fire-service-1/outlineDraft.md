# Draft Report Outline: Fire Services — Learning from Past Incidents

## Title (placeholder)
- Burning Lessons Unlearned: Has Hong Kong's Fire Services Department Adequately Applied Lessons from Major Fires?

## Executive Summary
- [To be written after the report is drafted]
- Key point: despite major fire incidents (Hong Kong tower fire, parallels to London Grenfell), evidence suggests the Fire Services Department may not have systematically learned from past incidents

## Background: The Problem
- Hong Kong has experienced several significant fire incidents:
  - Jordan fire (New Lucky House)
  - 2025 Tai Po/Hong Kong tower fire ([Reuters comparison](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/how-does-hong-kong-tower-fire-compare-other-recent-building-blazes-2025-11-28/))
  - Parallels to London Grenfell Tower fire
- The FSD had an IT data breach incident in 2024, raising questions about internal systems
- Emergency Alert System was described as a "white elephant" in SCMP letters
- Reference: `WebSearchReport.md` (5 rounds on FSD incidents, alert systems, Typhoon Saola)

## Existing Solution
- FSD performance pledge on response times
- Emergency Alert System for public notifications
- Internal review processes after major incidents
- Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance

## Room for Improvement
- **Hypothesis 1:** The FSD did not learn enough from the London Grenfell fire — specific safety measures that could have been adopted were not implemented
- **Hypothesis 2:** The emergency alert system used during fires (notification to residents) needs improvement
- **Questions to explore:**
  - Which FSD unit is responsible for studying past fire incidents and applying lessons?
  - What specific changes were made after the London Grenfell fire?
  - How were residents alerted during the 2025 Hong Kong tower fire?
  - What is the FSD's process for reviewing and learning from past incidents?

## Government's Replies to Our Enquiries
- [Placeholder — questions to be sent under Code on Access to Information]
- **Suggested questions:**
  - What review process did the FSD conduct after the London Grenfell fire?
  - What specific policy or procedural changes resulted from that review?
  - How does the FSD's "lessons learned" process work in practice?
  - What is the accountability structure for fire safety improvements?

## Complaints and Follow-up
- [Placeholder — to be developed based on government replies]
- If the FSD cannot demonstrate systematic learning from past incidents, lawmakers should push for a formal review mechanism
