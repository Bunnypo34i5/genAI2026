# Draft Report Outline: Fire Services — Fire Safety Education and Prevention

## Title (placeholder)
- Beyond Response: Strengthening Fire Safety Education and Prevention in Hong Kong

## Executive Summary
- [To be written after the report is drafted]
- Key point: the Fire Services Department's fire safety education and prevention programmes may not be reaching communities effectively, especially in older buildings and underserved areas

## Background: The Problem
- Fire safety in Hong Kong involves not just emergency response but also **prevention and education**
- The November 2025 Tai Po fire raised questions about building fire safety compliance
- The Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance mandates certain standards but enforcement and education remain challenges
- Older buildings (pre-1987) face particular fire safety risks
- Reference: `WebSearchReport.md` (5 rounds on FSD operations, equipment, training, Fire Safety Ordinance)

## Existing Solution
- FSD fire safety education programmes and community engagement
- Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance enforcement
- Performance pledges on response times
- FSD year-end reviews and statistics
- Community fire safety ambassadors programme

## Room for Improvement
- **Hypothesis 1:** Fire safety education is not reaching the most vulnerable communities — older buildings, subdivided flats, elderly residents
- **Hypothesis 2:** The FSD team responsible for fire safety education needs more resources or a different approach
- **Questions to explore:**
  - Which FSD team is responsible for fire safety education?
  - What is the coverage and reach of current fire safety education programmes?
  - How does the FSD measure the effectiveness of its prevention programmes?
  - What happened with fire safety compliance in the building involved in the Tai Po fire?

## Government's Replies to Our Enquiries
- [Placeholder — questions to be sent under Code on Access to Information]
- **Suggested questions:**
  - How many fire safety education sessions were conducted in 2024–2025?
  - What is the budget allocation for fire safety education vs emergency response?
  - How many buildings have been inspected under the Fire Safety (Buildings) Ordinance in the last 3 years?
  - What follow-up actions were taken for non-compliant buildings?

## Complaints and Follow-up
- [Placeholder — to be developed based on government replies]
- If fire safety education is underfunded or poorly targeted, lawmakers should push for enhanced prevention programmes

## Suggestions for Media Investigation and Coverage
- **Angle:** "Are Hong Kong's most fire-prone buildings getting the education and support they need?"
- Link to the Tai Po fire: what prevention measures were in place?
- Potential letter to the editor (SCMP) on fire safety education gaps
