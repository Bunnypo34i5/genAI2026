## Summary of Key Themes

### Emergency Alert System Failures
- Building fire alarms in all 8 blocks failed / were deactivated
- Manual call points require someone to physically break glass and trigger — residents didn't know how
- Hong Kong has a government Emergency Alert System (EAS) that was NOT used during the fire
- EAS has been used only once since its 2020 launch

### Emergency Training Gaps
- FSD delivered 324 talks to 16,550 people in 2024 — but was any training at Wang Fuk Court?
- 40% of Wang Fuk Court residents were 65+, likely the most vulnerable group
- Residents and staff were not familiar with fire alarm operation
- Expert recommendation: property management should invite FSD to train residents

### Investigation Progress
- Independent Committee established 12 Dec 2025; first meeting 5 Feb 2026
- "Systemic problems" identified — evidence to be disclosed in March 2026 hearings
- 30+ arrests including consultants, contractors, subcontractors
- ICAC investigating corruption in netting procurement
