## Title
**When the Alarm Didn't Sound: Hong Kong's Emergency Alert and Fire Safety Training Failures Exposed by the Wang Fuk Court Tragedy**

## Executive Summary
- [To be written after the report is drafted]
- Key finding: The Wang Fuk Court fire (Nov 2025, 168 deaths) exposed critical failures in both building-level fire alarm systems AND the government's Emergency Alert System, which was never activated
- The fire also revealed deep gaps in fire safety education and training for residents, especially elderly populations in older buildings
- This report examines two hard questions:
  1. What if the Emergency Alert System or a better alert system had been used during the fire?
  2. What if the victims had received better training related to fire?

## Part 1: Background — The Wang Fuk Court Fire

### 1.1 The Incident
- 26 November 2025, 2:51 PM — fire broke out at Wang Fuk Court, Tai Po
- 7 of 8 residential towers (31 storeys each) affected
- Fire took 40+ hours to extinguish
- **Final death toll: 168** (confirmed 16 Jan 2026) — Hong Kong's deadliest fire in decades
- Victims: aged 6 months to 98 years; 58 male, 110 female; nearly 40% of residents were 65+
- 10 domestic workers, 5 construction workers, 1 firefighter (Ho Wai-ho, 37) among dead
- 30+ arrested for manslaughter, fraud, corruption
- Reference: `GoogleNotes.md`, `MoreInfoOnline.md`

### 1.2 Why the Fire Spread So Rapidly
- Mandatory renovation works in progress on 40+ year-old estate
- Bamboo scaffolding with non-compliant protective netting wrapped around all towers
- **2,300 rolls of cheaper, non-fire-retardant netting** substituted after typhoon damage (July 2025)
- Foam/styrofoam boards sealed windows — residents had warned about flammability as early as September 2024
- Tower spacing of ~7.5m (reduced by scaffolding) enabled tower-to-tower spread
- 7 of 20 netting samples from upper levels failed fire safety tests
- Reference: IFSJ article, `GoogleNotes.md`

### 1.3 The Alarm Failure
- **Fire alarms in ALL EIGHT blocks did not sound** during FSD's previous tests
- Fire detection and alarm systems reportedly **deactivated or malfunctioning** during renovation
- Fire service installation contractor staff arrested for deactivating alarms and making false statements to FSD
- Residents relied on manual call points — video evidence showed residents **trying unsuccessfully** to activate them
- Many residents only learned of the fire when contacted by phone by family members
- Reference: SCMP articles, `GoogleNotes.md`

## Part 2: The Emergency Alert System — A Missed Opportunity

### 2.1 What Is Hong Kong's Emergency Alert System (EAS)?
- Established 2020, cost HK$150 million
- Managed by Office of Communications Authority (OFCA)
- Uses cell broadcast technology — sends instant messages to ALL compatible mobile devices on local networks
- Two levels: "Emergency Alert" and "Extreme Emergency Alert"
- Users cannot opt out of "Extreme Emergency Alert" messages
- Reference: `MoreInfoOnline.md`

### 2.2 The Hard Question: Why Wasn't the EAS Activated?
- **The EAS has been used only ONCE since its 2020 launch** — for a COVID-19 hospital notification in March 2022
- It was NOT activated during the Wang Fuk Court fire
- If 168 people died partly because they didn't know there was a fire, could a cell broadcast alert have saved lives?
- Key questions for government:
  - What are the criteria/thresholds for activating the EAS?
  - Who has authority to trigger the EAS? Is FSD authorized?
  - Why wasn't a Level 5 fire (the most serious) deemed worthy of an alert?
  - What protocols exist (or don't exist) for fire-related EAS activation?

### 2.3 What If a Better Alert System Had Been Used?
- Building-level: Manual fire alarms are a **single point of failure** — if deactivated or if nobody knows how to use them, they provide zero protection
- City-level: The EAS could serve as a **redundant digital alert layer**
- International comparison: Other cities' emergency alert practices for fires
- **Policy recommendation:** Mandate EAS activation for Level 3+ fires; require push notifications to residents' phones in affected buildings
- Reference: IFSJ article (Tu Yixin's analysis), `GoogleNotes.md`

## Part 3: Fire Safety Training — Were Residents Prepared?

### 3.1 FSD's Current Fire Safety Education Programmes
- **Fire Safety Education Unit** — part of FSD
- 324 community emergency preparedness talks in 2024, reaching 16,550 participants
- FSD Community Collaboration Network: 18 District Fire Safety Committees
- FAST Connect (teen engagement): 1,000+ members across 18 districts
- FSD App: 91,000+ installations
- Winter Campaign (Dec 2024): 100+ publicity activities
- Four key fire safety messages (smoke doors, escape essentials, annual inspection, battery safety)
- Reference: `MoreInfoOnline.md`

### 3.2 The Hard Question: What If Victims Had Better Fire Training?
- Wang Fuk Court: built in 1980s, ~4,600 residents, **nearly 40% aged 65+**
- Did FSD conduct ANY fire safety education at Wang Fuk Court?
- Were residents taught how to use manual call points?
- Were residents trained on escape routes during renovation (when scaffolding blocked windows)?
- The HK01 article reveals most residents don't even know fire alarms are **manual, not automatic**
- Former FSD director Anthony Lam: property management should invite FSD to train residents and staff

### 3.3 Gaps in Current Training
- **Coverage gap:** 324 talks reaching 16,550 people in a city of 7.5 million — is this sufficient?
- **Target gap:** Are older buildings with elderly residents prioritized? (Wang Fuk Court was 40+ years old)
- **Content gap:** Do programmes teach residents about manual alarm activation, renovation-phase risks, escape during scaffolding works?
- **Effectiveness gap:** How does FSD measure whether education programmes actually improve resident preparedness?
- **Budget gap:** What is the budget allocation for fire safety education vs emergency response?

## Part 6: Suggestions and Recommendations

### 6.1 For the Government
- **Activate the EAS for major fires** — define clear protocols and lower the activation threshold
- **Mandate digital alert redundancy** — building-level alarms + mobile push notifications
- **Expand fire safety education** — prioritize older buildings and elderly communities
- **Require evacuation training during renovation** — when fire systems are impaired
- **Strengthen contractor oversight** — prevent deactivation of fire systems without proper safeguards
- **Public disclosure** — regular reporting on fire safety education coverage and effectiveness

### 6.2 For Media Investigation
- **Angle 1:** "The Alarm That Never Rang: Hong Kong's HK$150 Million Emergency Alert System Has Been Used Once in 5 Years"
- **Angle 2:** "168 Dead, But Were They Ever Taught What To Do? The Fire Safety Education Gap in Hong Kong's Aging Buildings"
- **Angle 3:** Follow up on March 2026 Independent Committee hearings for new evidence
- Potential letter to the editor (SCMP) on emergency alert system activation policies

### 6.3 For LegCo
- Request FSD to report on fire safety education metrics and coverage
- Question OFCA on EAS activation protocols
- Push for legislative amendment to require EAS activation for serious fire incidents

---

## Part 7: Complaints and Follow-up
- [Placeholder — to be developed based on government replies]
- If fire safety education is underfunded or poorly targeted, lawmakers should push for enhanced programmes
- If the EAS remains dormant, questions should be raised about the HK$150M investment
- Follow Independent Committee hearings in March 2026 for new evidence and recommendations
