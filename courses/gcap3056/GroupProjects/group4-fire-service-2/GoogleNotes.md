| **Title** | Hongfuyuan Fire: Failed Fire Alarm Causes Public Panic - An Article Explaining How Fire Protection Systems Work |
| **Contributor** | Luk Kan Yiu Shannon |
| **URL** | https://www.hk01.com/article/60306899?utm_source=01articlecopy&utm_medium=referral |

### Key Facts & Comments

**Fact 1:** In the Hung Fook Court fire, the fire alarms in the other seven buildings, except for Hung Sun Court, did not sound.

> **Comment:** The owner or property management company has major responsibility to ensure that the fire protection equipment and facilities in the building are always in effective working order to ensure the safety of residents.

**Fact 2:** The public lacks a deep understanding of building fire protection systems and may even have misunderstandings. Some residents exclaimed, "Why didn't the alarm go off?" and "It only went off after the fire was extinguished!" In fact, the fire alarm there was manually activated, not automatically.

> **Comment:** It is evident that public knowledge of fire safety varies, which is requiring more education, such as posting relevant information in elevators and organizing workshops.

### Full Texts (Summary)

In the fire in Hongfuyuan, Taipu, the fire alarm of the seven buildings did not sound, which may make residents miss the best opportunity to escape. In the past month, many fire alarms, including Qingyi Chang'an Estate and Tuanmen Jingfeng Garden, have been reported as malfunctioning.

In the fire of Hongfuyuan, except for Hongxin Pavilion (Hung Sun Court), the fire alarm of the other seven buildings did not sound. So far, the cause has yet to be investigated. However, the fire department replied that the fire alarm system of the involved building was inspected in 2024.

The fire finally took the lives of 161 people. In addition to mourning, the whole city was also afraid of the fire alarm and worried about whether the fire system of the residence was working normally.

**Three fire alarms reveal the hidden dangers of the fire system. The public's lack of awareness:**

- On December 3, a unit in Anjiang Building, Chang'an Estate, Qingyi, suspected that a fire alarm was caused by lighting incense candles. The fire department confirmed that the fire alarm bell of the involved building sounded normally.
- On December 17, in the 4th unit of Jingfeng Garden in Tuen Mun, the resident suspected that the incense was on fire. Some people said that the fire alarm only sounded briefly. The fire department confirmed that the system was operating normally.
- However, the public does not have a deep understanding of the fire protection system of the building, and there may even be misunderstandings. On December 6, there was a fire on the platform of Fujing Garden...

| **Title** | Failure of fire alarms in Tai Po could have delayed rescue, cost lives, expert says |
| **Contributor** | Chang Yan Tung Brookye |
| **URL** | https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/society/article/3334567/failure-fire-alarms-tai-po-could-have-delayed-rescue-cost-lives-says-expert?module=perpetual_scroll_0&pgtype=article |

### Key Notes from Article
- Older residential buildings in the city have a **manual call points system**, which is a small box mounted on a wall that contains a button or a lever that allows people to manually trigger the fire alarm.
- Lam said property management companies should invite the fire service to **train residents and staff** on how to properly use any alarm system, while ensuring everyone was familiar "with the means of escape."

### Key Facts & Comments

**Fact 1:** Fire alarm has to be triggered manually.

> **Comment:** Fire alarm system installed for notifying residents of the existence of danger; if no one is willing to or stands out to help, it doesn't really do its work of "alerting people from danger."

**Fact 2:** Residents or staff are not familiar with the use of the fire alarming system; training is needed.

> **Comment:** Citizens are not well educated about procedures on dealing with fire, where they can call out the knowledge to handle emergency issues even under panic and pressure.

|---|---|
| **Title** | A Review of Seven Major Fires in Hong Kong in the Past 30 Years! From Garley House to Hung Fook Court in Tai Po, Revealing Fire Hazards in Subdivided Flats/Fire-Retardant Shelves/Escape Routes |
| **Contributor** | LU Haihong Iris |
| **URL** | https://www.storm.mg/lifestyle/11084096 |

### Key Facts & Comments

**Fact 1:** One of the core risks have always revolved around potential fire sources and flammable materials in construction projects (Ka Lee, Hung Fook Court, mini storage).

> **Comment:** The government should examine construction materials to improve safety for workers and citizens.

**Fact 2:** The complex defects of old buildings (tenement buildings/subdivided flats, mixed-use buildings) also is one of the core risks.

> **Comment:** Did the government regularly check those old buildings for potential risks and take action to protect residents?

### Timeline of Seven Major Fires

1. **The Garley House Fire (Level 5) (1996)** — killed 41 people and injured 81. Occurred on November 20, 1996, at the Karley Building in Jordan. Stemmed from sparks from welding during elevator replacement work.

2. **The Tsim Sha Tsui Karaoke Arson Case (1997)** — On January 25, 1997, a third-degree arson attack at a karaoke bar on Prat Lane in Tsim Sha Tsui. Motivated by a triad revenge plot; arsonist threw a petrol bomb.

3. **The Golden Harvest Building Five-Level Fire (2008)** — On August 10, 2008, fire in Mong Kok due to a nightclub on its mezzanine floor. The fire quickly spread.

4. **Level 4 Fire on Fa Yuen Street, Mong Kok (2011)** — On November 30, 2011. Started in ground-floor food stalls and quickly spread upwards to upper-level old-style tenement buildings.

5. **Level 4 Fire at Ngau Tau Kok Mini Storage (2016)** — On June 21, 2016, at Amoy Industrial Estate. Fueled by highly flammable goods; burned for over 108 hours.

6. **Fire at a Tent House on Canton Road, Yau Ma Tei (2020)** — On November 15, 2020. Despite being classified as Level 1, still resulted in 7–8 deaths.

7. **Tai Po Hung Fook Court Fire (Level 5) (2025)** — November 26, 2025, at least 146 deaths (later revised higher), the deadliest fire in modern Hong Kong history. Fire spread rapidly upwards from bamboo scaffolding.

### Summary
Looking back at the fires in Hong Kong over the past 30 years, the core risks have always revolved around potential fire sources and flammable materials in construction projects, complex defects of old buildings (tenement buildings/subdivided flats, mixed-use buildings), and inadequate fire safety systems.

| **Title** | Final death toll from Hong Kong fire placed at 168 |
| **Contributor** | Yick Minny |
| **URL** | https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cx2w9wqek3jo.amp |

### Key Facts & Comments

**Fact 1:** 168 people died in this Wang Fuk Court fire accident.

> **Comment:** The number has increased since it was last announced in November. This accident, in which more than 100 people died, reminds us of the importance of raising public awareness about fire safety and escape procedures.

**Fact 2:** More than 30 people have been arrested in connection to the fire.

> **Comment:** It highlights that this major fire disaster was due to human factors and could have been avoided.

### Full Texts

## Article 5: Wang Fuk Court Fire — Global Lessons for High-Rise Safety

| **Title** | Hong Kong's Wang Fuk Court fire and the global lessons for high-rise safety |
| **Contributor** | Tu Yixin |
| **URL** | https://internationalfireandsafetyjournal.com/wang-fuk-court-fire-lessons/ |

### Key Facts & Comments

**Fact 1:** The report confirms that "malfunctioning fire alarms delayed resident awareness until smoke and flames engulfed individual units." It specifically notes that the fire took more than 40 hours to extinguish.

> **Comment:** This proves that reliance on a single, building-dependent physical alarm system is a single point of failure. **Policy Recommendation:** Hong Kong must mandate a redundant digital alert layer (e.g., mandatory push notifications to residents' phones).

**Fact 2:** The investigation highlights that "initial figures reported 146 deaths... [rising] to 159," and that the rapid spread was due to "flammable renovation materials (mesh netting)" which compromised the structural integrity.

> **Comment:** Since the "stay put" policy failed due to external renovation risks, why wasn't there a mechanism to dynamically broadcast a "CHANGE OF STRATEGY" (i.e., "Evacuate Now") to residents' phones? **Insight:** The failure is not just in alarms, but in the absence of a dynamic communication channel.

### Full Texts (Key Excerpts)

- "When fire broke out at the Wang Fuk Court housing estate in Hong Kong's Tai Po district on 26 November 2025, it quickly became the city's deadliest blaze in decades..."
- The Incident: On November 26, 2025, a catastrophic fire broke out at the Wang Fuk Court housing estate in Tai Po, claiming at least 159 lives.
- The rapid vertical spread was attributed to the use of **non-compliant, cheaper protective netting** and **flammable styrofoam window coverings** used during renovation.
- **Fire detection and alarm systems were reportedly deactivated or malfunctioning during the maintenance works.**
- Residents had previously raised concerns about the flammability of materials (even conducting their own tests) and questioned the contractor's integrity, but regulatory inspections failed to prevent the disaster.
- The Hong Kong government launched a massive relief operation involving a **HK$2.3 billion support fund**. However, the political response was tightly managed, with arrests made under national security law.

### From IFSJ Article (Link 5) — Comprehensive Analysis

**Author:** Iain Hoey, International Fire and Safety Journal, 5 Dec 2025

#### Key Timeline & Facts
- Fire reported at **2:51 PM** on 26 Nov 2025
- **7 of 8** 31-storey towers involved; fire took **40+ hours** to extinguish
- Tower spacing ~**7.5 metres**, reduced further by scaffolding — enabled tower-to-tower spread
- Death toll rose from 146 → 156 → 159 → 168 (final confirmed)
- **1,000+ residents** accommodated in temporary housing; ~1,600 moved to transitional housing

#### Renovation & Materials Issues
- Renovation triggered by mandatory building inspection for buildings **30+ years old**
- After typhoon in **July 2025**, damaged netting replaced with **cheaper non-compliant material**
- **2,300 rolls** of non-compliant netting purchased at lower cost
- Compliant netting installed only at scaffolding base where samples were taken
- **7 of 20 samples** from near windows/higher locations failed fire safety tests
- **Foam/styrofoam boards** used to seal windows during renovation — residents had questioned this as early as **September 2024**
- At a September 2024 meeting, a styrofoam board **ignited rapidly when exposed to a cigarette lighter** in front of residents and project reps

#### Fire Detection & Alarm Issues
- Alarms reportedly **deactivated or malfunctioning** during maintenance works
- Fire service installation contractor staff arrested for:
  - Allegedly deactivating alarms during maintenance
  - Making false statements to FSD

#### Residents' Warnings (Pre-Fire)
- Residents filed complaint with **ICAC** about renovation
- Wrote to **Labour Department** and **Housing Bureau's Independent Checking Unit**
- **16 inspections** between July 2024 and November 2025
- Labour Department issued further fire safety warning on **20 November 2025** (6 days before fire)
- Inspectors accepted documents indicating netting compliance based on ground-level samples

#### Arrests & Investigation
- Engineering consultants, construction company directors, scaffolding subcontractors, and fire services contractors detained
- Offences include: manslaughter, corruption, fraud, false documentation
- **ICAC** confirmed substitution of cheaper non-compliant netting

#### NFPA Fire & Life Safety Ecosystem Framework
The article applies NFPA's 8-element framework to the incident:
1. Government responsibility
2. Development and use of current codes
3. Referenced standards
4. Investment in safety
5. Skilled workforce
6. Code compliance
7. Preparedness and emergency response
8. Informed public

**NFPA conclusion:** Prevention requires attention to ALL eight elements. NFPA 241 (Standard for Safeguarding Construction, Alteration, and Demolition Operations) highlighted as key reference.

#### Strategic Questions Raised
- How are temporary materials for scaffolds specified and approved?
- What controls exist to prevent substitution of non-compliant products?
- How are fire alarms managed during extensive façade works?
- What pathways exist for residents to report fire safety concerns?
- How is competence assessed when selecting contractors?
- Are enforcement powers calibrated to reflect life safety consequences?

#### Relief & Rehousing
- **HK$2.3 billion** Support Fund by early December
- HK$200,000 per deceased victim's family; HK$50,000 funeral expenses; HK$50,000 living allowance
- "One social worker per household" model deployed
- Judge-led independent committee announced (but without statutory powers of a Commission of Inquiry)

### From HK01 Article (Link 1) — Fire Alarm System Explainer (Chinese)

**Published:** 29 Dec 2025

#### How Building Fire Systems Work
- **Water system:** Fire hydrants in staircases, fire hose reels on each floor, fire pumps
- **Electrical system:** Fire alarm buttons (manual call points), flashing lights, emergency lighting

#### Manual vs Automatic Fire Alarms
- **Manual fire alarms** are very common in residential and commercial buildings
- Manual call points are installed next to fire hose reels; in newer buildings, they're placed before staircase entries
- **Automatic fire alarms** are found in buildings with sprinkler systems, smoke detectors, and heat sensors
- When sprinkler activates, flow detector triggers signal to fire control panel → alarm sounds
- Smoke detector → signal to fire control panel → alarm sounds

#### Emergency Response Steps ("Break, Turn, Pull, Shoot")
1. **Break** — Break the glass of the manual call point to activate the alarm for the entire building
2. **Turn** — Turn the water valve counter-clockwise to allow water flow
3. **Pull** — Pull out the fire hose, ensuring no knots or tangles
4. **Shoot** — Direct water at small fires

#### Legal Requirements
- Under Fire Services Ordinance, owners/management companies must ensure fire equipment is always in working order
- **Annual inspection** (年檢) required — must hire registered fire service installation contractor
- After inspection, contractor issues **FS251 certificate** within 14 days; copy sent to FSD
- Certificate usually posted in visible location for residents to check
- False statements on certificates can lead to **prosecution, suspension, or permanent de-registration**

#### Key Regulations
- Shutting down fire systems requires filing a **"Fire Service Installation Shutdown Notice"** with FSD
- Only during maintenance/repairs should systems be temporarily offline
- Property managers must provide fire extinguishers, sand buckets, and fire blankets as temporary compensation
