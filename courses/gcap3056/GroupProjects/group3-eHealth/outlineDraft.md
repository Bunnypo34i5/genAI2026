# Draft Report Outline: eHealth Integration for Insurance Reimbursement

## Title (placeholder)
- Streamlining Healthcare Costs: How eHealth Can Automate Insurance Reimbursement in Hong Kong

## Executive Summary
- [To be written after the report is drafted]
- Key point: eHealth has the technical infrastructure to support automated insurance reimbursement for medical bills, but this functionality has not been developed; patients continue to face cumbersome manual processes

## Background: The Problem
- Patients in Hong Kong must manually submit paper-based claims for insurance reimbursement of medical bills
- The eHealth system (Electronic Health Record Sharing System) already stores medical records that could facilitate automated reimbursement
- The VHIS (Voluntary Health Insurance Scheme) involves standardised policies but the claims process remains manual
- SCMP letters by Simon Wang and others have highlighted the potential for eHealth to streamline this process
- Reference: `WebSearchReport.md` (5 rounds on eHealth, insurance reimbursement, VHIS, FHB)

## Existing Solution
- eHealth system launched by the government for electronic health record sharing
- VHIS for standardised voluntary health insurance
- Manual claims submission process: patients collect documents → submit to insurer → wait for processing
- The Food and Health Bureau oversees eHealth development

## Room for Improvement
- **Hypothesis 1:** eHealth's technical infrastructure could be extended to support automated insurance reimbursement, reducing burden on patients
- **Hypothesis 2:** The government has not adequately explored the integration of eHealth with insurance systems despite the potential benefits
- **Questions to explore:**
  - What is the current technical architecture of eHealth?
  - Has any feasibility study been done on integrating insurance reimbursement?
  - What are the data privacy considerations?
  - How do other jurisdictions handle electronic insurance claims?

## Government's Replies to Our Enquiries
- [Placeholder — questions to be sent under Code on Access to Information]
- **Suggested questions:**
  - Has the FHB or Health Bureau considered extending eHealth functionality to support insurance reimbursement?
  - What technical or regulatory barriers have been identified?
  - What is the current number of eHealth users and participating insurers?
  - Has any pilot programme been proposed or considered?

## Complaints and Follow-up
- [Placeholder — to be developed based on government replies]
- If the government has not explored this integration, lawmakers should push for a feasibility study

## Suggestions for Media Investigation and Coverage
- **Angle:** "Patients still juggling paper receipts — why hasn't eHealth automated insurance claims?"
- Reference existing SCMP letters on eHealth for continuity
- Potential letter to the editor (SCMP) proposing eHealth-insurer integration
