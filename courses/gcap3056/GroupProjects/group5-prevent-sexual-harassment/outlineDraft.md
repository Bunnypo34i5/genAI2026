# Draft Report Outline: Preventing Sexual Harassment in the Community

## Title (placeholder)
- Breaking the Silence: How Government Programmes Can Better Prevent Sexual Harassment in Hong Kong

## Executive Summary
- [To be written after the report is drafted]
- Key point: despite legislative reforms (Sexual Offences law reform 2024), government programmes to prevent sexual harassment remain fragmented, with low awareness and participation, especially among young people

## Background: The Problem
- Sexual harassment remains a significant issue in Hong Kong:
  - Underreporting due to stigma and misconceptions
  - Only ~3,000 university students participated in training programmes (low coverage)
  - Persistent misconceptions about what constitutes sexual harassment
- The 2024 sexual offence law reform updated legal definitions but awareness is limited
- The Equal Opportunities Commission (EOC) handles complaints but faces communication challenges
- Reference: `WebSearchReport.md` (5 rounds on EOC, law reform, RainLily, workplace/school education)

## Existing Solution
- EOC conciliation process for discrimination and harassment complaints
- Department of Justice (DoJ) law reform on sexual offences (2024)
- Education Bureau (EDB) guidelines for schools
- Labour Department workplace guidelines
- Social Welfare Department (SWD) support services
- NGOs: RainLily, TALK Hong Kong, and others

## Room for Improvement
- **Hypothesis 1:** Government anti-sexual harassment education programmes are not reaching enough people, especially university students and young workers
- **Hypothesis 2:** The EOC's communication and outreach on sexual harassment prevention needs significant improvement
- **Hypothesis 3:** There is a gap between the law reform and public understanding of the new legal framework
- **Questions to explore:**
  - How many people has the EOC's sexual harassment prevention programme reached?
  - What budget is allocated to sexual harassment prevention education?
  - How does the EOC measure the effectiveness of its programmes?
  - What has changed in practice since the 2024 law reform?

## Government's Replies to Our Enquiries
- [Placeholder — questions to be sent under Code on Access to Information]
- **Suggested questions:**
  - How many sexual harassment complaints has the EOC handled in the last 3 years?
  - What is the resolution rate for conciliation cases?
  - How many awareness-raising sessions were conducted by the government in 2024–2025?
  - What plans does the government have to publicise the 2024 law reform?

## Complaints and Follow-up
- [Placeholder — to be developed based on government replies]
- If government programmes are not reaching target audiences, lawmakers should push for mandatory education and better outreach

## Suggestions for Media Investigation and Coverage
- **Angle:** "New laws, same silence — why aren't Hong Kong's anti-harassment programmes working?"
- Link to university student participation data (only ~3,000)
- Potential letter to the editor (SCMP) on the gap between legal reform and public awareness
