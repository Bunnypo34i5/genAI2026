The general philosophy: begin with the end in mind
we'll think about the final project report that will be submitted to the Legco Public Complaint Office. 
https://www.legco.gov.hk/en/legco-business/redress-system/handling-cases-received-under-redress-system.html 
let's fetch this and create a legcoComplaint.html and LegcoComplaint.md to describe how we should frame our report as a complain taking into account contents here Projects/genAI2026/courses/gcap3056/week4

remember to follow Projects/genAI2026/courses/gcap3056/ProjectMetaDirector/AIresponseGuideline.md when you prepare md file; html can be more visually appealing and interactive 

then we have a general structure of the Legco report 

Title 
Executive summary
Background: the problem 
Existing solution 
Room for improvement 
Government’s replies to our enquiries 
Complaints and follow-up 
Suggestions for media investigation and coverage

Note that the functional headings should be replaced by thematic headings 

Projects/genAI2026/courses/gcap3056/GroupProjects
let's create an outlineDraft.md of the report for each project team based on contents we have so far 
the contents should be minimal as most teams have just started the project 
but we should take into account task 4.1 and task 4.2 fetch relevant info from here https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GCsy8H3-49Z8JgxrxmhFEQDDqKoNTiLQyNfczot1Kd0/edit?tab=t.omet00l6dw0c

essentially we need to gather public info in order to describe the background (the problem) and existing solutions (critical review)
then we also need to get some info from the government to identify room for improvement

we have a section to review government's replies to our enquiries to comment on the ways they handle our enquiries 

then complaints and follow-up would be our argument that the government should have done sth and how the lawmakers should follow up 

finally we need to create more pressure for both the government staff and the lawmakers through a plan to engage the media 

the key decisions we have to make are - what decisions and programmes to focus on; in what ways can the government do a better job 

so the outlineDraft.md we should have some placeholders and suggestions on the above issues as well as questions for the government to answer 

write a reportPlan.md and create outlineDraft.md for each project 

leave some space for teacher and students to write comments 
link to other files in the project folder for reference 

once the outlineDraft.md and reportPlan.md are created, the next step is to review the WebSearchReport.md of each project and ask AI agent to perform another round of web search; also get input from the team members (very important)
then based on the input, we ask AI agent to revise the outline and raise questions for government staff 

generate and update process.log
