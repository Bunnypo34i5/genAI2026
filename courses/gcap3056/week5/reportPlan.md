# Report Plan: LegCo Complaint Report

## Purpose

- Each team produces a report framed as a complaint to the LegCo Public Complaints Office
- The report argues that the government could have done a better job on a specific programme
- See `week5/LegcoComplaint.md` for background on the LegCo Redress System

## Report Structure

Each team should prepare an `outlineDraft.md` following this structure:

### 1. Title
- Thematic (not generic); reflects the specific complaint
- Example: "Bridging the Gap: Improving Access to Rare Disease Treatment in Hong Kong" rather than "Rare Disease Report"

### 2. Executive Summary
- 1–2 paragraphs summarising: the problem, the gap, what should change
- Write this last, after the rest of the report is drafted

### 3. Background: The Problem
- Publicly available evidence on the issue
- Sources: media articles, government documents, LegCo discussions, research reports
- Reference: each team's `WebSearchReport.md` and `public-info.md`

### 4. Existing Solution
- What the government is currently doing to address the issue
- Specific programmes, policies, or actions
- Use official government sources and responses

### 5. Room for Improvement
- Hypotheses about how the government can do better
- Supported by evidence from public sources and research
- Reference: each team's hypotheses and questions (e.g. `group6-rare-disease/hypotheses.md`)

### 6. Government's Replies to Our Enquiries
- Analysis of responses received under the Code on Access to Information
- Comment on the quality and timeliness of responses
- Note: teams may not have received replies yet; include placeholder and plan for follow-up

### 7. Complaints and Follow-up
- The core argument: what the government should have done differently
- Specific recommendations for lawmakers to follow up on
- What accountability measures should be in place

### 8. Suggestions for Media Investigation and Coverage
- How to create pressure for accountability
- Potential angles for media stories
- Letter to the editor (SCMP) as an abridged way to express views

## Workflow

1. **Now (Week 5):** Create initial `outlineDraft.md` for each team based on existing content
2. **Next:** Review each team's `WebSearchReport.md` and conduct another round of web search
3. **Get student input:** teams discuss and provide feedback on the outline
4. **Revise:** AI agent revises the outline based on input
5. **Formulate questions:** finalise questions for government staff (Code on Access to Information)
6. **Send questions:** aim to send before the government response deadline allows replies by end of semester
7. **Integrate replies:** update the report as government responses arrive

## Key Decisions for Each Team

- **What specific decisions and programmes to focus on?**
- **What are the working hypotheses?** (How can the government do better?)
- **What questions to send to the government?** (Under Code on Access to Information)
- **What thematic headings to use?** (Replace the functional headings with topic-specific ones)

## Link to Assessment

- Community Engagement Portfolio & Report (by Week 10)
- Argumentative report + three appendices
- AI use allowed with prompts/edits and at least two human revision rounds
- See `courses/gcap3056/CourseInfo/Assessment` for full rubrics
