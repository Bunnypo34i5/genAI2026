# Framing Our Report as a LegCo Complaint

## What is the LegCo Redress System?

- The Legislative Council operates a **Redress System** to receive complaints from members of the public who are **aggrieved by government actions or policies**
- It also handles representations on government policies, legislation, and other matters of public concern
- Duty Members (groups of nine, rotating weekly) oversee the system and meet with complainants
- All case information is kept **strictly confidential**

## How a Complaint is Handled

- Complaint submitted via form or letter to the **Public Complaints Office**
- Duty Roster Members review the case
- An interview with a deputation is normally arranged **within 12 working days** of receiving a detailed submission
- The Office obtains relevant background information and responses from the government before interviews

## How This Applies to Our Course Projects

- Our projects critically review **specific government programmes** and identify room for improvement
- The Legco complaint format gives us a **framework** to present our findings and recommendations
- We are essentially arguing: the government staff could have done a better job; here is the evidence and here are our suggestions

## What We Can Complain About

- Government actions or decisions that affect stakeholders negatively
- Programmes that are not meeting their stated objectives
- Government staff who have not responded adequately to public concerns
- Gaps between policy goals and actual implementation

## What is Outside the Scope

- Requests for legal advice
- Private disputes
- Court decisions or matters that are sub judice
- Matters handled by independent/statutory bodies (e.g. ICAC, IPCC)
- Labour disputes (unless of wide public concern)
- Matters outside the jurisdiction of the HKSAR

## How to Frame Our Report

- **Begin with the end in mind:** our report should be structured as a complaint to the Public Complaints Office
- **The core argument:** we discovered something is wrong; the government should have done a better job; this is a hypothesis supported by our research
- **Evidence-based:** use publicly available information, government responses to our Code on Access to Information requests, and media sources to support our claims
