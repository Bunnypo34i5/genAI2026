### Task: Create LegCo complaint framing and report outlines for all groups

**Context:** Following instructions in `outlineReport.md` — begin with the end in mind; frame the final report as a LegCo complaint.

**Steps completed:**

1. **Fetched LegCo Redress System page**
   - URL: https://www.legco.gov.hk/en/legco-business/redress-system/handling-cases-received-under-redress-system.html
   - Extracted: complaint process, scope, contact details, workflow

2. **Created `LegcoComplaint.md`**
   - Summarises the Redress System: what it is, how complaints are handled, what is in/out of scope
   - Frames how our course projects connect to the complaint process
   - Follows AIresponseGuideline.md: concise, bullet points, structure from user prompt

3. **Created `legcoComplaint.html`**
   - Visually appealing version with flow diagram, colour-coded sections, collapsible elements
   - Same content as the .md file but designed for presentation/sharing

4. **Fetched Google Doc** (task 4.1/4.2 context)
   - URL: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GCsy8H3-49Z8JgxrxmhFEQDDqKoNTiLQyNfczot1Kd0
   - Extracted: week 5 plan, report structure, group assignments, task 4.1/4.2 instructions, student input expectations

5. **Created `reportPlan.md`**
   - General report structure (8 sections from Title to Media Suggestions)
   - Workflow: outline → review → student input → revise → send questions → integrate replies
   - Key decisions each team must make
   - Links to assessment and reference files

6. **Created `outlineDraft.md` for each of 6 groups:**
   - `group1-legco-data-access/outlineDraft.md` — LegCo data fragmentation and citizen access
   - `group2-fire-service-1/outlineDraft.md` — Learning from past fire incidents (London/HK comparison)
   - `group3-eHealth/outlineDraft.md` — eHealth for insurance reimbursement automation
   - `group4-fire-service-2/outlineDraft.md` — Fire safety education and prevention
   - `group5-prevent-sexual-harassment/outlineDraft.md` — Government anti-harassment programmes
   - `group6-rare-disease/outlineDraft.md` — Rare disease drug access and Mainland procurement

   Each outline includes:
   - Placeholder title (thematic, not generic)
   - 8 sections matching the report structure
   - Hypotheses based on existing WebSearchReport.md and public-info.md
   - Suggested questions for government (Code on Access to Information)
   - Comments section for teacher and student feedback
   - References to existing project files

**AI tools used:** Web fetch (LegCo page, Google Doc), file reading, file creation
**Human input needed:** Teacher and student review of outlineDrafts; teams to finalise hypotheses and government questions

### Next steps
- Review each team's WebSearchReport.md and perform another round of web search
- Get input from team members on the outlineDraft.md
- Revise outlines based on input
- Finalise questions for government staff (Code on Access to Information)
