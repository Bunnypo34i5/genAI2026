## Date & Time

## Venue

Zoom (online)

## Speaker

Dr Simon Wang, Lecturer and Innovation Officer, the Language Centre, HKBU

## Overview

When AI helps us write, is it acting as a **midwife** — assisting us in bringing our own ideas to life — or a **surrogate mother** — carrying and delivering the text on our behalf? Both metaphors capture valid modes of human–AI collaboration, and neither is inherently wrong. What matters is that the **ideas, direction, and intellectual ownership** come from you, the author.

This workshop explores the evolving landscape of AI-assisted academic writing. You will discover practical workflows for integrating AI agents into your writing process — from brainstorming and outlining to drafting and revision — and reflect on how to maintain academic integrity while embracing the productivity gains that AI offers.

## Objectives

- Understand two metaphors for human–AI writing collaboration (midwife vs. surrogate) and when each applies
- Explore practical AI-agent workflows for academic text production — from ideation to final draft
- Reflect on intellectual ownership, academic integrity, and the author's role in AI-assisted writing

## Key Highlights
