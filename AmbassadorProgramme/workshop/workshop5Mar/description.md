## Overview

Published academic papers are among the richest learning resources available — yet reading, synthesizing, and extracting actionable insights from multiple papers is time-consuming and overwhelming. In this workshop, you will learn how to use AI agents inside an IDE to turn published works into **textual mentors** that guide your own research and writing.

By feeding papers to AI agents, you can rapidly analyze methodology, argumentation patterns, and writing conventions across dozens of publications — and translate those findings into concrete strategies for your own academic work.

## Objectives

- Use AI agents to read, summarize, and extract key findings from multiple published papers at scale
- Treat published works as "textual mentors" — learn methodology, argumentation, and writing patterns through AI-powered analysis
- Bridge the gap between literature review and your own research by gaining actionable, structured insights
