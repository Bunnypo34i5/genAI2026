## Overview

Are you still using Gen AI by talking to a chatbot? This approach is outdated. To unlock the true power of Gen AI, you need to learn **Agentic AI** — AI that doesn't just chat, but actually works on your files and folders, writes scripts, converts documents, and automates tedious tasks for you.

This introductory workshop walks you through setting up an AI-powered Integrated Development Environment (IDE) — **Trae** or **VS Code** — and using AI agents to work directly on your files. No programming experience is required.

## Objectives

- Introduce AI agents in the IDE as a new way to interact and partner with AI
- Describe the strategies of editing prompts in files involving the use of file and folder paths
- Leverage Gen AI agents to process files (PDF, PPTX → Markdown) and generate code

## Key Highlights

| | |
|---|---|
| **Work Directly on Files & Folders** | No more copy-paste or context switching — AI reads, edits, and creates files right inside your project. |
| **Vibe Coding** | Write computer programs in plain English. Describe what you want, and the AI agent builds it for you. |
| **From Idea to Output in Minutes** | Generate reports, presentations, websites, and data analysis — all through natural language prompts. |

## Target Audience

- University students and scholars
- Undergraduates taking writing-intensive courses or preparing for presentations and closed-book exams
